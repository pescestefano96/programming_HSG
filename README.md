# Stock Screener

This project is part of the "Introduction to Programming" and "Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" courses at the University of St. Gallen (HSG) held in the spring semester of 2022. The purpose is to construct a so-called stock screener in Python following the stock trend following strategy of Marvini (2013).

Subsequently, the theoretical background and code structure will be explained.

### Context

A stock screener is a tool that allows investors to swiftly sort through the numerous stocks or other financial instruments  (egg, the rising exchange-traded funds) available depending on the investor's own criteria. Stock screening tools allow investors to use their own methods for determining what makes a stock valuable (long-term investors) or to spot a potential trading opportunity (short-term traders). Both technical and fundamental traders, as well as seasoned and novice investors, can benefit from these tools.

The wide range of financial securities can be narrowed down by investors using stock screening tools and their own set of criteria. Based on their individual needs, users choose certain investment parameters to begin the process. A fundamental investor, for example, might be more interested in market capitalization, earnings per share (EPS), operating cash flow, dividend yield, or similar factors. Instead, moving average levels, relative strength index (RSI) levels, average directional index (ADX) readings, and chart patterns, among others, would be of more interest to a technical trader.

### Building a stock screener in Python

1.	Identify the set of financial instrument to be sorted (e.g. an index like the S&P500).

2.	Identify the desired period of analysis.

3.  Select the conditions according to which the instruments will be sorted.

4.	Calculate the return and metrics needed to implement the conditions for the assets in the portfolio.

5.	Collect all the instrument that meet the conditions in a list.
