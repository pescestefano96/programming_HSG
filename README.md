# Stock Screener
A stock screener is a set of tools that allow investors to quickly select from the plethora of available stocks and rising exchange-traded funds based on the investor's own criteria. Stock screeners allow investors to employ their own methodology on what makes a stock or ETF valuable (long-term traders) or to identify a potential trading opportunity (short-term traders). Screening tools are useful to both fundamental and technical traders, professional and individual investors.

Stock screening tools allow investors to sort through the broad field of potential financial investments based on their own criteria. Users begin the process by selecting certain investment parameters, based on their personal needs. For example, a fundamental investor might be more interested in market capitalization, analyst recommendations, earnings per share (EPS), operating cash flow, multi-year return on investment (ROI), dividend yield, and so on. A technical trader would be more interested in moving average levels/crossovers, relative strength index (RSI) levels to indicate momentum, average directional index (ADX) readings to indicate strength, and chart patterns, among others.
